Running gmake in this directory will create 3 executables.  Only defineqflux
should be required to build the boundary dataset needed by SOM.  It reads
monthly-averaged surface fluxes from a control run for some number of years,
then defines 12 monthly mean QFLUX values.  The output file must already be
defined on the desired resolution, and have yearly mean mixed layer depths on
it.  This is most easily accomplished by running definemldbdy (cvs co ?????).

Monthly time diddling a la Cecilia Bitz and Karl Taylor by default is then
applied to guarantee that linear time interpolation as done during a model
run will reproduce the observed monthly means.  The resulting set of
equations is solved using general solvers from the C version of LAPACK
(available from www.netlib.org).  So this library must be installed before
defineqflux can be built.

Defineqflux requires compile-time specification of resolution parameters PLON
(number of longitudes) and PLAT (number of latitudes).  These are set in
defineqflux.h.



Another executable available (but hopefully unnecessary) in the definesomic
module is (also) called definesomic.  It adds necessary SOM fields to an
initial dataset if they are not already there.

The third executable, testqflux, prints out some statistics about the file
built by defineqflux.
