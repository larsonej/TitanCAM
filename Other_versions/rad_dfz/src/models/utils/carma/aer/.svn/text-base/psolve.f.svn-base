c  @(#) psolve.f  Jensen  Oct-1995
c  This routine calculates new particle concentrations.
c
c   The basic form from which the solution is derived is
c   ( new_value - old_value ) / dtime = source_term - loss_rate*new_value
c
c  Modified  Sep-1997  (McKie)
c    New particle concentrations due to coagulation processes
c    were moved to the csolve routine.  Csolve is called to
c    update particle concentrations due to coagulation.
c    This new psolve now updates particle concentrations due
c    to the faster calcs of the non-coag microphysical processes.
