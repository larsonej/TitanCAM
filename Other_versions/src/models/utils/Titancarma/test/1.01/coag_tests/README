This directory contains routines necessary for running
a test case to compare with the Smoluchowski analytic
solution (see Pruppacher and Klett [1978] pgs. 366-367).
The Smoluchowski solution assumes the following:

1. Particles are initially only in the first bin.
2. The coagulation kernel is independent of particle size.

The numbers densities of particles in bin k (where the
volume of bin k is k*v(1)) are given as a function of
a nondimensional time parameter tau.

To run the Smoluchowski test case, the routine
smoluchowski.f must be called at the end of init.f.
To compare the results with the analytic solution, run the
idl routine smol.pro.  This routine reads in the history
file model_his.out and plots the numerical and analytic
solutions.  The results are saved in the postscript file
smol.ps.

This directory also contains sample results for Mrat=1.5 and 2.0.
The size distributions for the Mrat=1.5 case have dips in the second
bin because two particles colliding in the first bin result in a particle
larger than M(2).

In summary, the files in this directory include:

smoluchowski.f		fortran code to set up numerical calculation
smol.pro		idl routine to plot numerical and analytic results
smol.1.5.ps		Postscript file with plots comparing exact
			results with numerical calculations for Mrat=1.5
smol.2.0.ps		Postscript file with results for Mrat=2.0
