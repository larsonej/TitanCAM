@(#) DEFAULT_RUN  Jun-2001

This is a brief description of how the default simulation is set up.

As shipped, CARMA is set up for a 1-D simulation of a liquid water
cloud forming in a rising bubble.  The particle types, specified
in aer/setupaer.f, include 3 elements (CN, droplets, and sulfate core
mass within droplets).  We have also included aer/setupaer.4elem.f,
which includes the core mass second moment element, and
aer/setupaer.8elem.f, which includes ice and mixed-phase elements. 
Processes that are active in the default simulation (specified in
aer/init.f) include droplet activation from (and evaporation to) CN,
condensational growth, coagulation, vertical transport, and radiative
transfer.  The vertical grid is set up in aer/initatm.f with 35 levels
spanning the height range from the surface to 17 km.  The dimensions of
the spatial and particle grids are set up in include/aerad.h.

The simulation runs 160 time-steps of 10 seconds (the time-step for
slow processes such as transport and coagulation), which are divided
into 2 to 1000 sub-steps at each grid point for fast microphysical
processes (such as nucleation and condensation).  Cloud formation is
forced by an imposed vertical wind specified in aer/prestep.f -- the
initial vertical wind profile has a maximum value of 5 m/s at 5.5 km,
and the height of the peak vertical wind moves up at 5 m/s throughout
the simulation.

The top-level makefile specifies compilation with g77 with
optimization.  On a 700 MHz Pentium III system, the simulation
takes about 20 seconds to run.
