! !INTERFACE:
PROGRAM program_csm
!
! !DESCRIPTION:
! Driver for CLM as the land component of CCSM.
! This program is the driver for CLM to work as the land component of
! CCSM.  The flux coupler will provide all the appropriate atmospheric
! forcing for the land model to run.
! o the land surface model returns to the CCSM flux coupler surface
!   fluxes, temperatures, and albedos for only the land points on the
!   [lsmlon x lsmlat] grid
! o the land surface model uses its own surface type data set. because
!   it processes only land points, this data set must correctly define
!   what points are land and what are not land
! o the land surface model uses its own grid dimensions (lsmlon and
!   lsmlat). currently these must equal lsmlon and lsmlat so that there
!   is a direct correspondence between the atmosphere and land grids
! o the zenith angle calculation is calculated for the
!   NEXT time step rather than the current time step. make sure
!   the calendar day is for the NEXT time step. make sure the
!   solar declination calculation is the same as in the
!   atmospheric model but for the NEXT time step. make sure the
!   calendar day is for greenwich time (see next comment).
! o subroutine calendr: this generates a julian day (with fraction)
!   based on the time step, which is used to calculate the solar
!   zenith angle. this time must be at the greenwich meridian to
!   get the correct zenith angle. also, output from this subroutine
!   is used to calculate the month (1, ..., 12), day (1, ..., 31),
!   and year (00, ...) of the simulation.
! o the land surface model calculates its own net solar radiation and
!   net longwave radiation at the surface. the net longwave radiation
!   at the surface will differ somewhat from that calculated from the
!   CCSM flux coupler because the cpl model will use the upward
!   longwave flux (or radiative temperature) from the previous time
!   step whereas the land surface model uses the flux for the current
!   time step. the net solar radiation should equal that calculated
!   from the flux coupler. if not, there is a problem.
