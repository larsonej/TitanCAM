sdev computes the standard deviation, means, skew and kurtosis of all the variables from an ensemble of datasets and places the results in file called "sdev.nc", "ave.nc", "skew.nc", and "kurt.nc"

If the -l option is used, it will also compute the top n L1 and L2 normalizations for each variable and print them to stdout.


usage: sdev [-l[n]] files
-l[n]: print out highest (n) L1 and L2 normalizations
