Typing "gmake" in this directory will create 2 executables.  The first
(definemld1x1) reads in ASCII mixed layer depth data from a 1x1 degree
dataset and puts it into netcdf format in both the original (monthly) form,
and also as a yearly average.  The Slab Ocean Model option in the CAM reads
only the yearly averaged mixed layer depths.  The original 1x1 data are from
Monterey and Levitus.  The data are maintained by Steve Worley in the
Data Support Section of SCD (see
http://dss.ucar.edu/datasets/ds285.0/data/woa94).  Please go to this
web page and download the file named mld.pd.tar.

The second executable, definemldbdy, runs after definemld1x1.  It takes as
input the yearly average 1x1 degree mixed layer depth netcdf file just
described, and bins it to the grid defined by a second netcdf file.  If
building mixed layer depths for the Slab Ocean Model, this second netcdf file
should be the boundary dataset on which Q fluxes from a control run will also
be put.  A convenient starting point is a copy of the SST boundary dataset
used in the control run for SOM.  Since the 1x1 mixed layer data have missing
values over land, a nearest-neighbor fill algorithm is employed to define
reasonable values over the entire globe.  The data are then capped at 200
meters, and an optional number of successive applications of a 1-2-1 smoother
(default is 10 applications) in both x and y are applied.  The data are then
written to the output netcdf file.

The most probable sequence of events is therefore something like:

definemld1x1 -m mldfile.nc -v                                
  (build 1x1 netcdf file)

definemldbdy -s 10 -v -i mldfile.nc -o pcmdi_sst_cam_bcT42_clim.032000.nc 
  (put that data on a T42 grid)

The final step before running the Slab Ocean Model is to run defineqflux (cvs
co definesomic) to define the Q flux values on this same boundary dataset.
That program requires as input the monthly-averaged history files from a
prescribed-ice CAM run.
